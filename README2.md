These are the Android samples for Google Play game services.

* **BasicSamples** - a set of basic samples, including a convenience library (BaseGameUtils):

    * **BaseGameUtils**. Utilities used on all samples, which you can use in your projects too. This is not a stand-alone sample, it's a library project.

    * **ButtonClicker2000**. Represents the new generation in modern button-clicking excitement. A simple multiplayer game sample that shows how to set up the Google Play real-time multiplayer API, invite friends, automatch, accept invitations, use the waiting room UI, send and receive messages and other multiplayer topics.

    * **CollectAllTheStars2**. Demonstrates how to use the Snapshots feature to save game data. The sample signs the user in, synchronizes their data from a named Snapshot, then updates the UI to reflect the game state saved in the Snapshot.

    * **TrivialQuest2**. Demonstrates how to use the Events and Quests features of Google Play Services. The sample presents a sign in button and four buttons to simulate killing monsters in-game. When you click the buttons, an event is
created and sent to Google Play Games to track what the player is doing in game.
